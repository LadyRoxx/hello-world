# hello-world
This is my midlife career reinvention from a hair/makeup to artist to a frontend web developer. 
I am committed to learning and mastering the skills needed to flourish on this journey.
Located in Connecticut (freezing my a** off :/) one of my goals of this new year is to move to a warmer climate -St. Petes maybe?!
I love the fact that I can use both sides of my brain as I am creating websites for all to enjoy.
